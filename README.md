## About Me
Hello world! I'm a motivated and hard-working software engineer with experience building highly scalable and robust applications across a variety of domains.

I began my journey in technology when I was just 16 years old. Since then, I've been extremely passionate about the field, and I'm always excited and motivated to learn new things about the tech universe.

I managed to get into college at just 16 years old, I am currently studying Information Systems at the Federal University of Par√° (UFPA).
